# DMT-Final-Project
Its the final project. For DMT.
-	This is a drum machine. Just drag the Drum Machine 2.0.amxd file into a midi track in Ableton and youâ€™re good to go! 
-	It includes a kick, snare, clap, closed hi-hat, and open hi-hat. You can scroll through the different parameters (which are color coded) to adjust the attack, decay, sustain, and release of the different parts of each instrument.
-	The kick is set to trigger when you press C3, the clap is C#3, the snare is D3, the closed hat is E3, and the open hat is F3.
